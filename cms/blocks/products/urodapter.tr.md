      - q: What is UroDapter®?
        text: >-
          * Moulded from medical grade elastic polymer

          * The specially designed radiused tip easily accesses the external urethral orifice

          * The sealing collar enables the leakage-free instillation of the bladder

          * With the ribbed grip it can be held fast when it is being mounted

          * With the connecting tail it can be attached to both Luer Slip and Luer Lock syringes

          * It enters the urethra merely in 6-8 mm depth

      - q: A small device with plenty of benefits
        text: >-
          UroDapter® is preferred by all patients to catheters, because: 


          * Performing the instillation with UroDapter® is pain-free

          * UroDapter®causes no lesions to the urethra

          * Unlike catheters, UroDapter® does not raise the risk of urinary tract infections

          * The instillation causes much less post treatment complications 

          * With UroDapter®, it is possible to treat the bladder and the urethra at the same time, which is impossible with a catheter

          * Both the duration and the cost of the treatment is significantly lower
      - q: One device for many indications
        text: >-
          Any solution can be instilled with UroDapter® into the bladder,
          assuming it has no adverse effect on the nearby tissues or organs. The
          device can be applied in the therapy of the following conditions:


          * Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS)

          * Recurring Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)

          * Post-cancer treatment: Chemotherapy-Induced Cystitis

          * Post-cancer treatment: Radiation Cystitis

          * Local recurrence prevention of Bladder Cancer, female patients

          * Severe Overactive Bladder Syndrome (OAB)

          * Instilling analgesics, local anaesthetics, and antiphlogistics for any indication

          * UroDapter® might be applied for diagnostic purposes, too – e.g. retrograde urethrography, fistulography
      - q: Strong legal background
        text: >-
          It has got the necessary European CE certificate, it is registered by
          the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and has strong IP
          protection in many countries.


          ​UroDapter®'s patent is pending. 


          ​PCT international patent application number: PCT/HU2016/000063
