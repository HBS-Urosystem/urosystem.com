      The GAG-Layer Integrity Test was developed for learning the status of the
      inner mucus layer of the bladder. Deficiencies of this layer can be
      observed in case of IC/BPS and certain other conditions. This diagnostic
      method is non-invasive, painless, provides quantitative information and it
      can be performed by any patient on their own.


      On this page, both patients and therapists can find all necessary information on the GAG-Layer Integrity Test.
