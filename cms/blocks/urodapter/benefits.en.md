      The UroDapter® is preferred by the patients to catheters, because:

      * Performing the instillation with UroDapter® is pain-free

      * The UroDapter® causes no lesions

      * The UroDapter® significantly reduces the risk of urinary tract infections

      * The instillation causes much less post treatment complications

      * With the UroDapter®, it is possible to treat the bladder and the urethra at the same time, which is nearly impossible with a catheter

      * When the therapist is familiar with the use of the UroDapter®, both the duration and the cost of the treatment is significantly lower
