      The UroDapter® is a small device that replaces catheter in the field of bladder instillation. Only the tip of the adapter has to be inserted into the urethral orifice to deliver the desired solution into the bladder, through the urethra. In this way, the UroDapter® makes the treatment painless and significantly reduces the chances of infections or complications.
