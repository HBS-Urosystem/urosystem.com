          * The specially designed radiused tip easily accesses the external
          urethral orifice

          * It enters the urethra merely 6-8 mm deep

          * The sealing collar enables the leakage-free instillation of the bladder

          * With the ribbed grip it can be held fast when it is being mounted

          * With the connecting tail it can be attached to both Luer Slip and Luer Lock syringes

          * Moulded from medical grade elastic polymer

          The UroDapter® is preferred by the patients to catheters, because:


          * Performing the instillation with UroDapter® is pain-free

          * The UroDapter® causes no lesions to the urethra

          * Unlike catheters, the UroDapter® does not raise the risk of urinary tract infections

          * The instillation causes much less post treatment complications 

          * With the UroDapter®, it is possible to treat the bladder and the urethra at the same time, which is nearly impossible with a catheter

          * Both the duration and the cost of the treatment is significantly lower

          Any solution can be instilled with the UroDapter® into the bladder,
          assuming it has no adverse effect on the nearby tissues or organs. The
          device can be applied in the therapy of the following conditions:


          * Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS)

          * Recurring Urinary Tract Infections (rUTIs)

          * Post-cancer treatment: Chemotherapy-Induced Cystitis

          * Post-cancer treatment: Radiation Cystitis

          * Local recurrence prevention of Bladder Cancer for female patients

          * Instilling analgesics, local anaesthetics, and anti-inflammatories for any indication

          * UroDapter® might be applied for diagnostic purposes, too – e.g. retrograde urethrography, fistulography
