    text: <blockquote> <p>"I've been given bladder instillations through this device
      for about 12 months now and it has completely changed how I feel about
      instillations.</p><p>Instead of using a catheter they place an
      adapter onto your urethral opening. The amazing part is that the
      injection is now essentially painless – and absolutely no pain after
      treatment.</p><p>Talk to your health provider. This is a massive
      improvement for anyone doing bladder instillations."</p> <cite>A

    text: <blockquote> <p>Using a catheter for intravesical treatment required mental preparation for the unpleasant and painful procedure, which could potentially lead to infection. In contrast, using the UroDapter® does not cause me mental distress, it does not cause pain, does not hurt my urethra, and it has never caused any infection or complications in 1.5 years. It can be inserted into the urethral opening with ease and without causing any damage. </p> <cite>Reka S. D.<br>Female IC/BPS patient<br>Hungary, 2023</cite> </blockquote>

    text: <blockquote> <p>I am a retired hospital employee and an IC/BPS patient. I came across the UroDapter® on YouTube. I love the idea!

    text: <blockquote> <p>The UroDapter® is the best invention possible. Dr. Lovász has saved his patients from severe pain with this device. Intravesical instillations have become a very gentle procedure thanks to the UroDapter®. You can only feel very mild pressure during its application, whereas a catheter painfully injures the urethra. Furthermore, with this method the urethra is treated as well, especially since my main issue is urethral burning. I don't believe my urethral pain would have gone away with a catheter. I recommend using this device for anyone undergoing intravesical cocktail treatments. I would no longer consider undergoing intravesical treatments with a catheter on a monthly basis.</p> <cite>Edit K.<br>46y female IC/BPS patient<br>Hungary, 2023</cite> </blockquote>

    text: <blockquote> <p>Last year I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis. It is an extremely debilitating disorder that nearly destroyed my life. In my experience, catheters not only caused numerous infections but pain and irritation making each bladder instillation an anxiety filled experience.</p> <p>I cancelled all my bladder instillations as every single time that we used a catheter I would end up with an infection. In the hours of endless research, I came across the UroDapter®. Without hesitation I purchased a set and asked my doctor to use it instead of the standard catheter. My doctor loves using the UroDapter® and went to great lengths to order them for the clinic. She like myself saw the immense benefit of using it in lieu of a catheter. That tiny attachment has been a game changer in my treatment! More people need to be made aware of it. I am your biggest advocate, I tell everyone who will listen about this miraculous invention. Since the incorporation of the UroDapter® into my weekly bladder instillations, I am actually getting better and my quality of life improved in ways I’ve never thought possible!</p> <cite>Kathy P.<br>Female IC/BPS patient<br>USA, 2025</cite> </blockquote>

    text: <blockquote> <p>The UroDapter® has resulted in a significant shift in how I manage my interstitial cystitis. Before discovering this device, managing my condition and treatments was often marked by discomfort, risk, and frustration.</p><p>Prior to the UroDapter®, I tried a variety of different treatment options. I had to be catheterized for both assessment and for treatment. Not only was this painful, but the risk of infections was always a consideration. The UroDapter® has really transformed my experience. The discomfort associated with catheterization is no longer an issue. This revolutionary device’s design ensures a gentler approach, completely eliminating any discomfort during instillations. There is also a significant reduction in the risk of infections or damage to my urethra due to the device only going a small distance into the urethra. Previously I had gotten a complicated UTI, one that could not be treated with regular antibiotics, most likely from catheterization.</p><p>I now have confidence, less apprehension, more predictability, and an overall a better quality of life.</p> <cite>Hannah J.<br>27y female IC/BPS patient<br>USA, the Netherlands, 2023</cite> </blockquote>

From the moment I first interacted with the products, it was clear that the UroDapter® is at the forefront of innovation in their field. The design and functionality of the UroDapter® are nothing short of impressive and are incredibly well-engineered.

    text: <blockquote> <p>I have been using the UroDapter® for almost 5 years and have had a very good experience. For patients whose primary complaint is in the urethral area, the adapter makes it almost painless to deliver the medicine into the bladder, which was unthinkable with the single-use catheters used previously. For men, its use is easy to learn. In women, due to anatomical variations, the learning curve is a bit longer, but with the patient's cooperation and appropriate instructions, the experience can be gained to easily deliver the drug into the bladder without loss. This is a real help for the IC/BPS patient group.</p> <cite>Dr. Marianna Nagy<br>Urologist<br>Dept of Urology, Homeland Defense Hospital<br>Budapest, Hungary</cite> </blockquote>
