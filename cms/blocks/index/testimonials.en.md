    text: <blockquote> <p>My name is KP. Last year I was diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis. It is an extremely debilitating disorder that nearly destroyed my life. In my experience, catheters not only caused numerous infections but pain and irritation making each bladder instillation an anxiety filled experience.</p> <p>I cancelled all my bladder instillations as every single time that we used a catheter I would end up with an infection. In the hours of endless research, I came across the UroDapter. Without hesitation I purchased a set and asked my doctor to use it instead of the standard catheter. My doctor loves using the UroDapter and went to great lengths to order them for the clinic. She like myself saw the immense benefit of using it in lieu of a catheter. That tiny attachment has been a game changer in my treatment! More people need to be made aware of it. I am your biggest advocate, I tell everyone who will listen about this miraculous invention. Since the incorporation of the UroDapter into my weekly bladder instillations, I am actually getting better and my quality of life improved in ways I’ve never thought possible!</p> <cite>- Kathy P.<br>Female IC/BPS patient<br>USA, 2025</cite> </blockquote>

    text: <blockquote> <p>"I've been given bladder instillations through this device
      for about 12 months now and it has completely changed how I feel about
      instillations.</p> <p>Instead of using a catheter they place an
      adapter onto your urethral opening. The amazing part is that the
      injection is now essentially painless – and absolutely no pain after
      treatment.</p> <p>Talk to your health provider. This is a massive
      improvement for anyone doing bladder instillations."</p> <cite>A
