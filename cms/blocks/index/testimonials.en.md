          #### *"I've been given bladder instillations through this device for about
          12 months now and it has completely changed how I feel about
          instillations.*


          #### *Instead of using a catheter they place an adapter onto your urethral opening. The amazing part is that the injection is now essentially painless – and absolutely no pain after treatment.*


          #### *Talk to your health provider. This is a massive improvement for anyone doing bladder instillations."*
