      There are 5 million indwelling catheters administered yearly, for several
      different
      reasons.[1](https://www.urotoday.com/urinary-catheters-home/indwelling-catheters/description/indications.html) As
      it was stated before, these catheters often cause infections. Moreover,
      the catheter itself may cause lesions (when it is being administered or
      dismantled), debris of the applied devices or clots may appear in the
      bladder, too. These also increase the risk of infections or other
      complications.[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4673556/),[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4985380/) It
      is possible that occasional instillation of a GAG-layer replenisher
      solution strengthens the layer itself, which might be an effective way for
      preventing the complications. Further research and examination are needed
      on this topic.


      In the field of diagnosis there are possible uses of UroDapter as well. Retrograde urethrography, for example is usually performed with a catheter with which the contrast materials needed for imaging are delivered. In certain cases, the administration of these materials to the urethra too might reveal additional information.


      Lidocaine, as a local analgesic, is often being instilled into the bladder in many different conditions. Regardless of the condition being treated UroDapter can be beneficial to deliver lidocaine. It is an additional advantage that the drug affects the urethra, too, since in many urinary conditions patients experience pain in that area as well.
