      With a yearly incidence of nearly 550,000 (worldwide), bladder cancer is
      the 6th most common cancer in men and the 17th most common in
      women.[1](https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/cancer-trends/bladder-cancer-statistics) In
      the non-muscle invasive (superficial) form of the disease intravesical
      instillation is an effective method of reducing recurrence; the two most
      frequently used drugs are BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) and
      mitomycin.[2](https://www.healthline.com/health/bladder-cancer/bcg-treatment-for-bladder-cancer),[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562793).
      Gemcitabine and valrubicin are less commonly used: the former one is less
      efficient but causes less side effects, the latter one may be applied if
      the patient has not responded to BCG. The therapy usually lasts for six
      weeks (one instillation per week), the maintenance therapy thereafter may
      last for 1–2 years (with less frequent instillations), depending on the
      pathological staging. It is suggested by some experts that one single
      instillation after transurethral resection of the bladder might help lower
      the chance of
      recurrence.[4](https://www.eu-focus.europeanurology.com/article/S2405-4569(18)30189-5/fulltext)


      Theoretically, performing the local chemotherapy with the UroDapter® would be beneficial because the drug would affect the urethra, too, where neoimplantation of tumorous cells could occur. Further clinical trials are needed to certificate this indication.


      Practically, in male patients there is an issue that must be pointed out. In case the urethral pressure is high, the drug may enter the spermatic cord and reach the gonads, too. To assess the risks and the precise effect of the chemotherapeutic drugs on the gonads further research is needed. On the other hand, UroDapter® may be used in  women: because of their different anatomy similar issues shall not emerge.
