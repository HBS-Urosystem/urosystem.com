      Founded in 2016, Hungary, Urosystem has been developing a portfolio which includes medical devices, medications and diagnosis methods focusing on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) or recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs).


      Urosystem is primarily dedicated to advancing and commercializing the inventions of Dr. Sándor Lovász, MD, PhD, urologist – one of our founders – and his colleagues. Dr. Lovász is a globally recognized expert in IC/BPS, with extensive clinical experience, having treated hundreds of patients successfully.

      In parallel, a key priority of the company is to preserve and further develop the vision and business concepts of our co-founder, Gábor Rényi. We conduct our activities in line with his entrepreneurial spirit, committed to creating long-term value for both our partners and our patients.


      Urosystem Co. Ltd. has obtained a D&B Failure Score AAA certification. This indicates that the financial risk of establishing a business relationship with the company is low. Only 0.63% of Hungarian companies have this certificate.
