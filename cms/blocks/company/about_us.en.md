      According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the USA) Interstitial
      cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is “a complex, poorly understood syndrome
      of unknown etiology”. Its most common symptoms are chronic bladder pain
      accompanied by urinary frequency and urgency. There are at least 5 million
      people suffer from it alone in the USA. Due to the exceptionally poor
      diagnostic rate of the disease, the number of latent patients can reach
      100 million people globally.


      Urosystem has been developing a portfolio which includes medical devices, medications and diagnosis methods focusing on IC/BPS. Our vision and mission are to restore the quality of life for millions of people around the world by bringing our solutions to patients and doctors to be able to timely diagnose, effectively treat, and follow up patients through their lifetime. Most elements of the portfolio can be used in the treatment of other lower urinary tract conditions, such as recurring urinary tract infections (rUTIs) or chemotherapy cystitis.
