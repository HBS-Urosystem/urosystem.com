    text: According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, the USA) Interstitial
      cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is “a complex, poorly understood syndrome
      of unknown etiology”. Its most common symptoms are chronic bladder pain
      accompanied by urinary frequency and urgency. There are at least 5 million
      people suffer from it alone in the USA. Due to the exceptionally poor
      diagnostic rate of the disease, the number of latent patients can reach
      100 million people globally.
