            text: With a heavy heart we inform you that Gábor&nbsp;Rényi, our beloved colleague,
              the founder and co-owner of our company passed away due to a
              severe illness with tragically quick progression on the 31st of
              December, 2023. 
              
              
              His drive, initiative, wisdom, and power of
              motivation will be missed by all of us. He was the engine of our
              company, the person we could always count on regarding everything.
              Our work shall be proceeding in the spirit of his intellectuality.
              
              
              Gábor’s funeral will be arranged by his family.
